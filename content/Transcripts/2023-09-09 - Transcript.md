Elise: I want to give it to you as a whisper, but it might take too long to type.
Jen: Do you want to just tell me?
Ben: I got the nat 20.
Elise: Okay, do with that info what you will, uh, okay. So did you guys determine, let's just do, uh, okay. We know Lotta's in room, in the bedroom. Uh, Barney, where would you have been? 
Ben: I was with you and, I mean, didn't I go in through the side door?
Elise: I mean, everybody did the big fight over here. So everybody did the big fight in this chamber and then I can't remember. So I'm just letting you guys pick now. Oh, yeah. Okay. So Lotta, Lotta and Barney are in here. Jackie, would you have gone into the bedroom, which is kind of like where the spoils and stuff were? Um, or would you have stayed in? Okay.
Kevin: I'll just hang out outside. Kind of like here. In the hallway? With other Nundro.


Elise: Yeah. So yeah, I feel like. Yeah, so he's kind of like in between making sure other Nundro is like. Yeah, because you haven't seen into the room yet. Exactly. And then where would you have gone? Okay, so you guys are kind of like right here. Yeah. Okay. That was what Stevie noticed. Okay. All right. So you have your medicine check. You have your answer. You guys are kind of all where you are. You check. I'm going to tell you. There's some. Leave him tied up. Don't want. He has. There's different. This is. These are not. So I'm going to run back and tell you to tie him. Yeah, the one that we already cut. Okay. Like just tying back. Do I need to do a tying check? No. Yeah. So. Okay. So you go and tell them. So are you going to go and tie up re-tie up the Nundro in 19? Nundro 1. Nundro 1. Okay. He will not resist, but he is very and does protest white loud as you're doing it. Yeah. I don't get it either. This is. This is absurd. I just was freed from that absolute psycho. I'm going to tell you to grab him and haul him in here with us. Nundro 1. Nundro 2. Yep. Who's carrying? Because he's not going to. He's not going to walk. You're going to do a strength check. Actually, give me athletics. I'll probably help. I'm tying him up. Yeah. You guys can bomb do it. Yeah. Grab him by the arm. Athletics. Yeah. Actually, you can pick. I don't care. Athletics or strength. Seven. Eight. I'll do my job. That's on his own. Do you have any personal advantage? Oh, that's what it is. I look at. I look at Jackie. You can either do two people rolls or one person has advantage, but good tries. Oh, I look at Jackie and I'm like, I'll carry him. He goes ball is less. And on some cases. Looking through your arms. Oh, you are really heavy. I'm not. pretty good as you're dragging him. Down, down, down, down. We're all having this, like, fight. Like, we're going to carry this beside Indi, this is how. I can't see him as he, like, something that, you know, hits his head on the door frame. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. What, what, huh? Stop, please, stop. We put it together? Yeah, yep, yep. We'll get some help. We'll do it. Let me cup you. Oh, okay. Okay, fine. I thought I could do it. Let's just get his head apart. Do I have, hold on, let me turn you, see what I got. I guess we should have stabilized him, I guess. Sorry. Should we do a full body split now? I'm sorry, here, here's my quarter. Full body split. Do we have a blanket? I have a blanket, I have a quarter, stop. Can we stick him on the blanket and drag him? Sure. Let's stick him on the blanket and drag him. One, two, three, lift. Okay, got it. Mission accomplished. Hey, how did that go? Do you want to roll on it or? Yeah, are you going to do another medicine check on him to see how he's doing? I want to do it. Okay, will you please check on him? Yes, I will. I just needed to be asked. Will you, like, heal him a little bit? Thirteen. Do you have a cantrip? I don't have a cantrip, not for that. Well, maybe. All right, I take my last healing potion out of my pocket. Oh, poor guy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop. Oh, wait, he's already, spare the dying, he's already been spared. I will tell you with a 13 medicine check, you're going to want to do that. Okay, what did I find out with my 13? Your 13, he doesn't look good when he's already got possibly some kind of injury and now you've added a possible TBI on top of it from, like, dragging him on the floor. All right, I'll come. Regular potion of healing. You're doing a potion of healing? He's stabilizing him, are you still, do you still want to? Do you want me to do that? Yeah. I don't want to torture him with questions. That's right, that's right, we're losing, we're losing it as a party over here. We're getting, we're getting, we're getting. How does that roll? There's another. All right, I take it. Yeah, the guy's going, I don't remember, I don't play Five Knee anymore. Just bring the whole school down. Yeah. Not many people can say that. Not four. Two to go. Show me. I got eight. Right there, right there. Thank you. One equals five. Okay. Not dead. He looks a lot better. He went from negative numbers to a five, so. Whoa. He was really close to death. And then we moved him. Um, and. He'll never walk again. Hey, go lay down. All right, so now we've got him against this guy. Um, yeah, I think once Barney pours it down his throat, he. And does, he choked on it a little bit. But he is, he does look like he's coming to, he's not fully awake. Uh, number one has stopped bonelessing, uh, as you drag out. Literally his physical counterpart. Neither of them seem surprised. That's what I want to see. That's what I want to, an insight check. Yeah. Anyone who wants to can roll an in check. You got a 15. Oh, I incite the heck out of that 24. 24. Not 20. Not 20. Not 20. Man. You're like third, 13. It's time to use real dice. You're distracting me. I was distracted by the spider. Spider over there. Okay. What was yours? 15. We got a 24. 15, 24. Everyone else got lower. Okay. Okay. Um, to everyone else. Yeah. I mean, what you would expect seeing second one of you. Um, Bartleby, you can't tell if it's just that he beat up. He's knocked around. Something seems a little off. You can't quite put your finger on. On which with which one? Uh, the other one is still just wait. So your insight check was on Nundro. Okay. So Nundro seems a little off. So yeah. Well, okay. So how about let's do this. We're going to call them bedroom Nundro and hallway. Yeah. Cavern fight room. Okay. So fight room. Nundro is the one who's away. Yeah. So, so now we're all out in the, because she noticed. What was that? Okay. The one in the little room. Yes. One in the little room was unconscious. And now because Barney poured stuff down his throat, but, but they brought him out into the big room where the big room Nundro got retied up. So for you guys, it all looks correct. Bartleby. Something is a little weird. This guy threw that spell that she was all time. Zone of truth. It would be. I did not take zone. You're elective. I am. All right. So I want to see what happens. I want to all play out. I want to see what keeps happening. Bedroom. Okay. Anyone else in the meantime, it'll take them. But anyone have anything else? Insight. Investigate. Yeah. And try to make sure. So I'm going to tell Lana. Yeah. Lana already did that. As, as this other. Do I remember this? They were rock colored. Color. Got. Okay.  Yes, yes. This is Barney. Yeah, 17. No, not really. These two are supposed to be the same guy, or maybe they're not. They have different clothes. They're inni. Oh, and they're inni. And so, oh yeah, he's laid out. This guy looks like he's been in battle, and this guy looks like he's been beaten up. This guy's been in battle. This guy's been beat up. Little Nundro has been tied up. Yes, yes. Little Room Nundro was tortured and tied up. Big Room Nundro does have wounds, but battle was much more active. You can roll a history check. Because we haven't found the other brother, right? But it doesn't make sense. That wouldn't make sense. So I want to ask it. A nine. Why would I know? I've been with that black spider. He's been doing magic of all kinds. Forge is screwy. I should have never come here. I mean, besides the fact he has my face. It is a little... You think. And now, my... my captors. They're not my captors. My rescuers have tied me up again. Are you going to beat me up too? No. We haven't yet. No, we're not going to beat you up. Well, that's what the black spider did. We don't know. We don't know the history. Brother. Tell us something about your brother that your brother might have told us that only we would know. I'm a teenager. That's spot on. I've been rescued by idiots. Just ignore him. Just ignore him. Gundren really likes ale. Oh, yeah, because that's a virgin. That's weird. Okay, what are you going to know that I would know that no one else would know that Gundren would have told you? I just need to do my part. What color are Gundren's eyes? I'm pretty sure they're brown. What color are your mother's eyes? Blue. What color are your brother's eyes? Which one? I feel like you're a bad example of this conversation. Don't you ever look someone in the eye until you love them? It's worth a look, alright? Um, yeah, I think at this point Little Rue Nundro is awake. You guys left him tied up, right? You haven't... So he is coming to. He is awake, but you can tell he has no idea what is going on and is very fearfully trying to stay quiet. Okay. Who tortured him? Yeah. I don't know what's going on. I don't have any answers. I don't know who that person is or why he has my face. Please don't hurt me. We have a Nundro. Nundro? Seeker? We know about Nundro. I don't remember it. Let me see how much you guys would have remembered. I think I knew Gundren. I think by history I knew Gundren. Everybody sort of knows Gundren, but nobody knows his family is the problem. Because Gundren is who hired him. So, like, the most you've met him a couple of times. Some of you guys know him more than others, I believe. Lotta had a, like, longer backstory connection. Maybe not. Somewhat. There were two people who didn't. I can't fully remember. But really what you know about him is he is a dwarf. He hired you to carry a wagon of provision over to Phandalin. And he didn't tell you at first, but it was because he and his brothers had found a map mine and forge, which was their ancestor's mine. So this mine has kind of crossed hands several times. Orcs who wanted it. And if you guys remember, there was a lot of, like, dead bodies and stuff. There had been a massive, massive war battle here. Yes. You guys did find two brothers that had been missing. And Gundren died as well, right? Nope. Gundren is back in Phandalin. He was like, I'm not Captain Noisy. That's what I paid you guys for. So you did find not Nundro. You found the other brother dead. Sildar is who... Sildar, he was the big fighter that was like the head captain for Gundren. That you guys saved from Krag. Oh, I can't believe it. It did. You guys had to travel, I believe. Yes, you guys did. You guys did find a necromancer. Just because she's like... Was his name like Carl? I feel like it was something weird. It was, uh, Coast. Coast is his name. Carl is... Yeah, he was pretty managed. I'm in Coast. What do you think? Do you think we can just, you know, trust these guys up and... I think you'd have a much better chance of getting it resolved then. I think... I don't think we're going to get it out of the game. Yeah, we're... Um... Thar'dim. Oh, we got to get... So... Because you also do have the body. I'm going to... I'm going to ask the... The... Well, let's ask. Okay, can we separate you guys? Yeah, you guys can do that. Can I ask a question? No, that's fine. Okay. Um. Okay, so who's going with big room, Nundro? Who's going with small room? Small room? Thornchurch. Yeah. Who's got the light? The room we're still in? They're just split. You guys are just separating them. Taking them out to their rooms. No, not even. Just like other corners of the room. Yeah, just to be like, what happened? I was here the Tuesday. I agree. I'll go with big room. Okay, so big room, big room, small room. You're going to stay in the middle. Keep an eye on both. Mara. Okay, ask them the same question. Okay. So we're going to ask them what happened. Yeah, how did you get to this place? What happened after? Scare her. Okay. So we'll ask them both. Um, Jess, no. You guys can make rules if you want to try the insight. I will tell you their stories just to like skip forward a little bit on this room. Okay.  he says doppelganger and I was like I remember something my grandma used to tell this story as you it was like a bedtime story you know how grandmas have the worst bedtimes yeah I know was you there with the bad guy in the story was a doppelganger and there was sleeper anyway to any would you know it was in the forest and children would disappear if they were disobedient like they do in all the stories but the thing that's weird about the doppelganger is she described exactly this type of the guy in the forest it's like and that was that he rolled is when he rolled he's like after a long time okay oh they're at you and deuce rather and the giant floating eyeball that's talking in their head would would a doppelganger it's gonna say they even know it the third topple yeah you know what you know I'm gonna ask you are boss yeah yeah you guys have a little bit um he also rolled and he would tell you he's like I know vaguely the term sure that's what I've got I don't even know if they're a full race or there's a creature that makes sense um so he would also tell you he would say the forge it would kind of he's like it it has been I'm not good um it has been really on the lately um you know it's not a perfectly steady theme anymore you guys do see as you're watching it it doesn't go it spurts a little I just and that's yeah this is you guys are in the actual like there's a bellows and like everything but it's all connected that so the black spider did something he had I mean it was dark magic is affecting the whole area I don't you guys me how did Bigger get in yeah I mean I fought against I'm are you asking this right now and under a beer I told you I tried to fight the black spider and his his drowned companion that that woman it did not go well I am NOT a fighter and you look at how come how come how can you don't have injured fighting chance they they they they hurt me tied me up I was tied I tried to escape I couldn't so that's we're in that world after yeah so put all isn't that isn't that is it because get they both get knocked unconscious because one of we fought before no one of them so they both they both tried to fight when the brother died they both tried to fight and escape both got caught they both got knocked out little one got taken to the little room yeah but never managed to break his bonds but before that he didn't get injured neither one of them neither one of them diverge in that part so they both didn't really get injured other than they got captured they got knocked out the big room nundro tells you it was after he was like there was I managed to break my rope bond okay and then the little one was like I was tied too well I never made my bond I was locked in this tiny so I'm just gonna go ahead and my guess is that the black spider did something with black magic and version save memory all that happened to try one of enough answers at some point in a copy that's my hunch the way you're both here normal there are you seen neither of you scary so let's go back to it let's go back to gun drain and I mean pretty much you guys cleared the for you have literally met the basics of your contract you found the Forge you got rid of the bad guys you found one of the two brother you found both brothers three brother you got three congratulations you have an extra brother which one of you wants to trade yeah so pretty much you've and and everything else he has Sildar so like you've taken care of everything that's like terrible it's up to Sildar and Gundra to get for working or whatever they want yes they both are okay they say that they're fine to walk I want to go a more moss more mess you want us to kill the one thing you want to kill yes please it doesn't require a check it really never was gonna fight back because it's a walking skeleton that like if you take a swing on it it will fall too so I remember right where it is I open the door whack door and if anybody was still near the Forge you would actually see more mass go up in a blaze if he is it was a spell his soul and his body had gotten separated and then his body got transformed into a spectator and guardian for the Forge could do all sorts of bad spells that he never did to you guys because if I remember correctly one of you guys lied and said you owned or said that you for Gundren and Gundren anyway he thought that you guys were the boss so he was okay we let him go yeah I remember that so we told some you did it you did it enough good for just exaggerating and then now that dudes gone do I see that there's anything you can take advantage of in this room um I don't believe so I think you guys had gotten everything you shot him in the room that didn't happen because it was the you shot him in this room over here and like room number five four had the magic like Healy water and then there was like nothing in this room and so you like shoved him in and like mark the door and I was like I I guess that's the way to do that that's right I forgot about that so let's do water cooking yeah yeah and down if you guys would like to stop everybody can you know that I'll take a sip and I believe it gave you like so everybody gets 2d 4 plus 2 healthy 4 plus 2 yeah if you guys drink from the magic oh sure it's 2d it's the one that's pointing up so 4 and 3 so 7 9 you get 9 1 and 1 nope for this case because you guys are leaving it just full heal before I teach people that's right that that just 9 because it's 4 plus 3 is 7 plus 2 if you're taking the water it's essentially a microchip were you were you googling things were you googling things Spongebunt you know I've been feeding notes I had funny I had funny know something about Barney rages against the black spider the rest of us know the black spider won't last and start young Jack and I made a group to tend to Roxy they managed to pick the lock with some luck and the door and they find a dwarf on the floor of the bar that is trying to help and I just had a list of which is important yeah okay sorry you guys heading back out like yeah let's get out of here I'm not walk right back to it will take you you'll have to stop for the night so what I was gonna like I kept thinking about like is there a way to your mind it work like I could talk to you for your like acknowledge you well there's actually is a trap in the beginning of war really want I don't believe you tell you I'll tell you that's what I was trying to look at stuff we to something that feels very minds you're really influenced by minds of Moria because this was not like a generational I'll remind you this Forge wasn't like passed down like it's father to son to father to son there was like a coalition of dwarves gnomes and wizard that like co-owned got it forever ago it was originally the dwarves minds that they called in the gnomes curve better at dispelling would make the the doors would make the items this would help dispel it the protection it works my little I'm sorry you rolled crabby my little since I there is something I don't I swore were you were probably the one that yeah I think you oh that's totally yeah I'm just gonna start insulting are you guys taking watch yes I'll take one what is the order of the watch okay so what is the deal with this it is a full out they so they may do the river yeah so full elves for hours of yeah not a sleeper but it's essential but aren't you a half-elven on full elf you still have to get all right I'll take a lot as first no I'll take second watch third but Barney if you watch it I go for a walk or three but Barney can come here there is a hold on don't don't push anything yet because you gotta see how the night goes we gotta see how the night goes so all right so the night goes on a lot of air first and until death death you would super alert everything um you're sick did you guys make a campfire well hold on you feel safer like if this is are we and the necromancers outside we do have a good outdoorsman but but do we feel safe I'm trying to remember what this was like before there's works of what that would be a lot of yeah we'll do a retroactive everybody can do everybody can do a perception it's pretty low DC of 15 13 okay so everybody you guys kind of surmise find your back out and and they smoke that work  any Rhea chants, but you feel an Izzy that, um, it gets a little chill. It's not like you're gonna die of gulps that you also probably don't have. Um, but you guys feel pretty, pretty okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You can sufficiently hide this lot of Rhea. Are you good? Destiny. Oh my god, I can't do this. Don't make a fire. Um, okay. Yeah, the whole watch. No. Um, I mean you, but you're right. Your own watch. Every other watch has, um, to get into Dawn's, um, lucky a figure from, um, and it kind of looks, yeah, you rolled a, uh, it looks like it's, yeah, everybody. Yeah. I haven't went back to sleep, but it's cold. It's like that wake up and you don't want to get out. So I, so I look around, so I look around and if I have it there, yeah, I look at the bedrolls to confirm that because I'm, I'm weirded out by the old awful childhood props. I told the story over the campfire. Yeah. So you see the figure being off. So you, thank you. Okay. Um, okay. I'm going to, do I notice? So I'm immediately going to check it. No, none of those are there. Okay. So I'm quiet. Pretty sure you just go to the bathroom. Uh, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna rouse Barney. I, okay. So rouse Barney, uh, and say Lotta. Are you being? I'm trying to be. Roll a stealth scanner. Uh, it is in skills. Go to the very bottom. Full, full, terrified, full ready to go. Ready to kill somebody. No, go to your, it's, it's in skills where, where, uh, oh, it's, you know why? It's because you're, I bet. No. Really? That's like the third. It just can't fly. 21, 21. I freaking am right now. 13. 13. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. Okay. I'm going after her. Okay. Well then stealth is gone. There is no, so if you're running, then you are not stealth. Okay. Well, okay. Stealth. Okay. So do you think? Yeah. Yeah. I'm telling her. Okay. Okay. You guys go head off. I'm just gonna. So, so yeah, like sneak after and watch just to what? Okay. So in the time, I mean, you guys are not in like a wide open play. There's lots of, so you saw the direction, but you don't into low. Are you behind? I don't know. I was just, did you go with her? Well, I started and then I was going to say, I realized they, one of us needs. So I'm saying, yeah, I'm going to leave it. I don't want to wake everybody. I don't want to wake everybody up yet. I just want someone to say, but I also thought I could be born. No, no, no. Okay. Right in the eye. Not super hard. Just enough to give you a quick black eye. Roll an unarmed attack. That's not, that's fine. There's no flat foot. And she's going to say, and punch. You can roll with advantage. She's letting you roll twice. Really? Like, was that, that was the, well, that was it. Oh, I do. So do it one more time. Is advantage with it. You just get to roll twice and take. Okay. So the other one was, that's fine. It's because we're asleep. I take one. I'm a barbarian all the time. That's true. A barbarian has to be hurt to stay interested. That's fair. So I just take my axe and it's like, cut me. That's fair. I'll give it to you. I can do four or what? Nah, just, you're able to, I mean, you see like, I can do like, damn. All right. You guys are chasing. Hey, now, now that you've done this. Okay. Well, they have gone. They, they have left. This could be here. So one of the two. So, so either one person can roll with advanced or eat to try to, you guys want a new advantage or, okay. I will let you invest or buy. Well, I haven't, I've been, I've been pretty conservative. Yes. It's like, um, if you've ever been, so it's got like a kind of, yeah, like Rocky. Oh. And while tracking the whole thing, numbers, let's answer to how long ago they passed. What's that? That's true. That's true. That is so I can still, uh, cause that will, um, so I will say, and just Barney is what, um, there is a moving off. It's kind of, um, a lot of as tracking following, um, I will roll all of the trail past the couple. And as you're going come to where he, well, it's and that's, but you still, you haven't lost them more of cut to them, but you can't quit when Barney are there. And you know, that feeling you'll like someone's watching. Um, I will say, I will say the perception checks are to be at dark and been outdoors, and we silent five. And then I disappeared. So five to do. So tell their buds making noise. It's hard to tell with that. Your own book shuffling is Barney shuffling. It feels so real. Welcome to the party. Um, that's what I do. It's role playing. Otherwise you'd have a lot. Okay. Um, so you guys hear some stuff right there. Um, still have that said hard to tell how much okay. I think I think like, Hey, the jigs up. Come on out. Yeah. How about solid one seven on. Okay. Uh, yeah. I get to add. Okay. Nobody can play a 17 year old better than though. Don't even one second. You're going to pretend to be here. I'd love to see this. I would love to see it. Come on out here. See what I mean? Seriously. You can't make this. Okay. Wow. Um, I definitely am. I, uh, okay. So if this clearing was a big, sir, you guys kind of ran in right party. You said you were circling around. Are you running to the right or to the left? So you have like a little sink, but it's dark. We've been listening that time trying to see if there's something. Um, no, you don't even need to check. You guys are talking. We're trying to hang over. You're, you're not being selfie. You're calling. Um, what did, what did you just listening? Just look to see if anything, neither of you guys longer all the way far, far, a lot to see up out, you know, like, and this figure is not in a white uncanned, uncanned wonder about. It's not quite slider. Um, it looks so no hair cloak. I'm trying to study. So what would Barney, but also not an intimidation. We own it. So, um, it will, as a, cause shadow drought, uh, you're all small is there for Nezah. It's going to come fight. What's it sent? Um, both of, um, Nezah want his last fire. So sorry. It was, it was, yeah. So she turned it to the last fighter from back in it. So she said, I was here as our, it's helped the power watched it up. It's not worth. Um, I liked, you don't have to urge once until that don't stalkers. All right. Barney. Nope. Let it go, man. Let it go. You said that. Oh yeah. That would be a lot. Absolutely go. Nope. Barney, Barney, Barney, get back here. And Barney starts to, and there's that exchange. Actually. Yeah. I think you were probably being pretty like water, right? You weren't going to be quiet. She will turn around and look at you and she will change. I also invited you title. What we bored. You did it. So I'm like, is that really our fight? Is that my wrong here? We're going to go back. I'm going to tell people, um, they, they, that's not our problem. She did say that it was my mind. She doesn't, she's not walking right into the shadows of their side again. All right. Okay. So what, um, someone met a game does very correct about what it was. So yeah, so out of, so out of character notify. So, but your characters don't know that beyond where he said, doppelganger sparked memory of, we're going to head back to, but I, but I'm kind of, we're going to come tell you guys. Would that work for, I don't know. I already thought it would. Barney was like, wait, stop all the way back. Hundreds of them. Okay. All right. That gives us 10 days. Just get matching tattoos. I'm sorry. I searched through his bedroll and stuff. Tell me you're not letting this So, I don't know, I think we need to zoom back in. He was very selective about who he was. Yeah, what did you, did you just think, I didn't wake them up, I, I went back, doing a nearby, uh, very quiet, sort of bedroll of Nundro trying, uh, trying to learn. So, it just means, um, stuffsy, uh, but, but, um, yeah, it is, it's like the, the Celtic symbol, so it actually stylized, um, little, um, Bartles. You mean I told you I don't remember? Yeah, you must have some, would you, would you have? No, I did have something, I remember, I do have a shield. Just be a symbol on your, I'm just asking, to see if you. Yeah, that must have been it, cause that's. Is yours on your shield? It must be, yeah. Okay, yeah, none of them know. Anyways, um, actually, um, so his is on his shield, I'm in the chat, they all kind of, but not one that you ever, not, I'm chatting. Yeah, we're a holy symbol. Yeah, big, religious, very icon. Um. So, can I do a history check on it? Um, you can do a religion check, but I cannot. Uh, it is, um. Or be dead? Oh, yeah, strong. Um, no, you don't. I'd be my third for. Very large value. Or you can eliminate, no, you can eliminate that it doesn't belong to. Like, like, it's not, uh, Judaism, it's not Muslim, you know, it's not like the big, it's not the crescent moon, it's not a Star of David, it's not a cross, it's fake. Any of the like. So I know it's like a. It's like a. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's definitely something. It's like a, it's like some gold to your ear. It's super disarming. What is this? Um, okay, and then, uh, I don't know, I'll kind of walk around and buy this. So like, they didn't do before, I know. The second. Uh, well, uh, I'm not going to wake them up. Well, I'm not, I'm not waking. I don't, I don't hear any fighting. Um, you guys come back. I assume wake up the. I don't know what they're. We can tell them in the morning. Not that. Before. And another idea to put a. We're going to fall back on that. Thankfully, we got lots of, lots of. I'm going to wait you guys up until what we're going to. Clearly not a drow. We fought it once and it is what it is. Oh, we're shorted out. That, that, that actually exists. And he's just pretending to be her, even though she really is. Yeah. I'm going to check the references up. Right. That is just, just, just like rabbits. Hoppery. Well, just like deer are good at hiding. Your own hand would nothing happen. Did it from thing to just second. However it were. Uh, Nazar was the black spider. Uh, Nazar. Yeah. I, I might go and spot it. It might, you know, I thought. Yeah. So, so just to remind you guys. So, so what? Yes. He was the red cloak. Like anyway. So the, the black spider was like, like they all were playing multiple characters. Last staff headaches. Yeah. I are no Albrecht glass staff. Uh, you got a, you guys found a letter, um, in his office that. Yes. Like he signed it as our writer and, or I had like a style I have to go. Anyways. It's not a few. I still got the letter. I'm just, I remember looking back to Agatha, the heartbeat. So recalling in my life. Hyper. The tower was where the warlock. Yes. And if you guys remember, he said, yeah. Yeah. Say he doesn't, but he very forever ago. Power. Uh, I built this whole like home bird forgotten. Well, yeah. In my, in my. No one said that. So in my, in my, like, like now I'm questioned at the tower. Now I'm all like, so we'd rouse them and share all the story. Decide you still haven't had your long rest. Little bit left to get up. So like, where are you? Well, I'm not going to tell Elman. It's fine. You guys, it's plenty of time. It was on work. Wait. So if you guys want to go back to Bay pass and further interruptions stabbed in the night by a creepy giant white and guy. I mean, there's a chance. It's not on you still. We're not wondering that with all the side belt. There's a chance. Smiling yet. Go to sleep. Party. All the road to fire. All that. Are you sleeping? Qualified short rest. I will give you the short rest. I really mean, I still make you roll. You know what? I'm not. It's not me being mean. We're staying up all night. Roll a constitution. Say they grow. Oh yeah. It's DC 10. You thought it was an elf. You are really worked up about this. You have the level of exhaustion. You're like, why your dude up? Come on. The 10 rest. Yeah. Everybody else. Take your rest. The campfire. Yeah. It's not that bad. And it'll go away. It'll be so good. Short rests are. Oh, you clicked your. Okay. You guys like Nundra. Wakes up. Oh, you guys. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Nundra wakes up completely. Feeling much, much better around. I was locked up. Tortured. Hello. Hello. Who's the wise? Um, and I will say for everybody, you guys realize like, especially not like super noticeable, like you'd have to be clever. Yeah. She noticed that original and then afterwards is saturated. And it makes sense when you think about the creature that you saw had no color at all. The thing about the coloring. It was just like all color from them. It wasn't even like a lighter bright white and that everything was kind of like, yeah, yeah. Like, like, you know, the best way I can, but like, or if you've ever seen Milter where like it gets and it gets that kind of every white era, it was kind of like, yeah, yeah. One had some, you didn't really get it. Like you didn't stare closely at the other and you don't. It's not a bad thought. Who's socially awkward? Did we tell you? No. Is it all? I'll be like in Mike where smell a bit. I heard that he had to sit there repeating it all. Like, what are you doing? Take it back to town then? Yep. You guys make it back further. I do. Um, um, you guys go to country. Go actually. I have a question. The limited tournament. I'm like 78% sure. Okay. Yeah. I think so. I think that's, I think we go straight to Lotta's like, kind of ready for our go back Lotta's like, kind of ready for her to go back to the fire. She doesn't know if it ever, I mean, it looks like. I know. That's what she wants. Whether or not she gets it, that's totally up to her. Gundren obviously does leave Andro for his part. He does say no. And you know when, brother, you feel very good that this is working. It all makes sense. Gundren, for his part, you guys. If I can write this in this title, you'll be receiving percent of my money. I know. That's not ten percent. That's absurd. Ten percent as a true. So think on it. I don't know if that's a joke. I've never heard of it. I've never heard of it either. Yeah, I did too. Yeah. Yeah. And didn't one of you guys get approached? I did. And you? Okay, I have that in my notes. It didn't. It didn't. He pulled me aside. Yes. I can't remember the name. I don't know. I'll find it. Well, and what's the group name? Bonded and Licensed. Everybody call the B&Ls. How did you know? None of us know that the 17-year-old was legally registering us as an incorporated. Last time we were in town, he named Bonded and Licensed. It's very clear, right? They do say name your business, what you do. We're both bounty hunters and mercenaries. Well, you guys are going to have a whole lot of opportunities to come back with different things that that B&L represents for you. Two Bonded and Licensed. It can't be. No, no, no. And I don't feel I'm going to set up a game against you. No, no, no. I'm pretty sure the 17-year-old said it himself. No. That was filed days ago. You guys are misleading. You guys don't know that if you go to a clerk, she's completely unhelpful. The cutoff. That was yesterday. You didn't file those forms by 5 o'clock. It can't be yesterday. I'm sorry. My hands are tied. If Barney's over at the clerk's office doing his paperwork, none of us are paying attention. I can't even read tumblr. Great. So now we have undivided joint ownership. So it's not partial pieces. We all own an equal percentage of the organization. Everything the clerk's saying, he's just writing on the piece of paper. Are you Bonded and Licensed? Bonded and Licensed. There's five of us. So that means there's always a time-breaker in the vote. I feel like Bonded and Licensed is a beautiful DC company. Our dissolution clause, if you dissolve, then it is. It was like a train wreck, it just kept going. There is some paperwork you need to do designated persons until you take your ownership, should you establish a parish or die in the lane. Are you seventeen? Was this one of your merit badges? Did you have to fill this in? He's not even a legal, he's not even a legal dog, can you let him do his business? If you want to refile, it's a BF5 gold, four month license, keep me honest, good enough for me. Never ever speak of this again. Well only when we work with anyone ever, it's always going to be that story, like how did you get your little gooblin doll? I really regret that now. Is that a tattoo? So we should get a tattoo, Doppelganger would never take that, honestly, Doppelganger is too embarrassed to put that on his face. Wait, an additional ten gold? No, cause he already paid, but you're like, I'm sure the mind will be making profits, eventually, but until now, wait, actually, I cleared out. That is. Cleared out, let me think of a magical crab. That's fine, I'll give you ten. Okay. That's it. Again, edible. Okay, so according to my loss, we each put up twenty percent, which would have been fine to handle, you know, potential legal fees and transportation issues and other auxiliary expenses related to our work. Okay. Time off. Goes towards, like, way older than him to be like, I just need Ben to work, I just get a laugh and walk away. He will, as you guys are doing all this, he'll like, look at you and then turn to the rest. But he will offer the party as well, a ride back, never would like, but you are always my brother. Another time, working on the mines, all of war, you'd be like, nah, we killed it, we just- You're supposed to go. No, I feel like we need to tell them all. I need to be brother enough. At least tell them all. So, yeah, I think we need to tell them all. A whole story. A whole full debriefing. Yes, like, this is a night in the tavern, full disclosure of when it didn't get said, like, we gotta- Tell them. They're ridiculous. Okay. So, let's get to the buddies. He would be like, yeah, so he'll buy y'all lunch and pull you into, like, Zeldar will love him. Would you guys share everything about the dopple as well, the hat? And, okay, let me- Out of all the- Water. It was a lot. I have a lot more than what I- I didn't- I think that- That was a lot. I don't- You guys are- You guys should be pretty- Splash. I think I gave you three gold. I gave them three- I'm not yet- The skeleton. The skeleton dopple. In the tomb. In the tomb? Yeah. I feel like that's an important disclosure now, like, that's definitely, like, they won't be surprised when there's this little weird thing, and they go to show up in the lid, and then it's fiery. And then they die. Horror comes out. Which is, like, there's literally no way to stop that, and it kind of does not- Oh, that's right. Short of, like, figure out how to- Anything else? Otherwise, I'm gonna- Everything in the story. If the doppelganger- Don't think of anything. I say, like, pulled us every- Because he paid us- Out. Definitely told them about- Yeah. What apple? You know, Tildar is- Um. Tildar. How about you do- Oh, yeah. You guys picked up a lot of stuff. I just asked, man. Because he said- I'm flexing. I'm flexing. Yes. Uh, that was in that- You guys- The, like, Harvey. Oh, yeah. The stuff that- The MG. There were- You guys have a lot of stuff. And there were more things, but smaller. Um. Nothing terrible. Um. I also have a- He would look at your symbol, if you show him the magic symbol and the little, like, stub. Um. No idea. No one- Um. The- The- Ticket. They're not- But, um. They can- That. I didn't, um. It is, like, nuts. You can kind of make out- But it- Um. So he's like, maybe go there if you figure out why they had this. Otherwise, you guys, you're welcome to be late. But- Long rest. Yeah, and you guys do rest. Um. It- It is 11 real life. Stop it. Why are you stopping? For all the- Go to Old Owl? Leave Old Owl. Well, it's- I just bought, sir. Uh. That is the- That was the statue. That was the guy. Yeah, we did that. No, I lied. Old Owl. Well, it's- Oh. Uh. Kony. You said- We did that. Yeah. You got the animation. Um. And everybody levels up to level 5. Oh, the Thunder Tree. That's where we never went to ride. Uh. Something about- Um. You guys did it. You guys- Um. But you haven't- The Wyvern Tour had, uh. There was a- Yeah. So, yeah. So, you did Old Owl. Well, you said- Whatever. Higher. You have to go to your character and then manage level. But you don't have to- Um. And Saturday. No. What about- Uh. Well, I- I've actually- I was deciding on another drop. Until the end. I mean, I was- Uh. Well. Yeah. It was a triathlon. But we're- As far as I know, today. Yeah. I don't see anything. Oh. In fact, the kids will be out of school. And, um. I feel like it was something else. This fall break- I'm open. Yeah. Let's just plan on what you're gonna make. I cannot do anything. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open.
