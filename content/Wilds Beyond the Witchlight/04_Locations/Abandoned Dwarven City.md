## Description

A vast underground dwarven city built into carved rock homes, organized in seven pie-slice segments with spoke streets. The city is eerily dark except for phosphorescent Dwarvish messages spelling words like "lost," "we've been failed," and "the rune slab lies."

- Seven-segment layout with spoke streets leading to center
- Stone cairns that were once dwarves
- Floating rune stone in the city center with glowing, unreadable runes
- Bioluminescent messages in Dwarvish on building walls
- Hidden entrance through optical illusion in mountain cave

## Secrets/Notes

- Regular "rumbling" occurs in the city
- Two types of houses: those marked "lost" with intact cairns, and ransacked homes where people fled
- The transformation appears selective - some escaped while others turned to stone
