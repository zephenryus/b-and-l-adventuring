# 2025-05-30 - The Trinket Revelations and the City of Stone

Well now, I reckon last time we found our intrepid band of adventurers knee-deep in conversation with that mystical unicorn, [Lamorna](Lamorna.md), who proved herself quite the font of wisdom regarding the peculiar trinkets our heroes had been lugging about.

It appears each bauble tells a tale of [[Prismeer|Prismeer's]] fractured realms - that ethereal shawl of [Lotta's](Lotta%20Corzaren.md) being a proper cloak of invisibility (though only good for an hour's worth of vanishing twice daily, and only in [[Yon]], mind you). [Bartleby's](Bartleby%20the%20Bard.md) ball-and-cup contraption turned out to be worth a potion of vitality, while young [[Barnabus Fleetfoot|Barney's]] chicken foot promised answers if he'd crack the bone at the right moment. [[Jaquline|Jackie's]] piano key would grant her the gift of darkvision for a full eight hours when needed. Most intriguing was [Destiny's](Destin-y%20Dub.md) tooth - a hero's relic with three doses of liquid courage left in it.

The unicorn delivered sobering news: Prismeer's very foundations were crumbling under the hags' influence, and without freeing [[Zilbna]], the whole realm would collapse faster than a politician's promise.

Our company then set off for the mountain pass, following the three-foot claw prints of what could only be that fearsome Jabberwocky - though the beast had taken to wing before they could make its acquaintance.

The real discovery came in the form of [an abandoned dwarven city](Abandoned%20Dwarven%20City.md), where phosphorescent messages spelled doom in Dwarvish runes. The poor folk had been turned to stone cairns, save for one enterprising deep gnome named [Wrefren Boldkind](Wrefren%20Boldkind.md), who'd taken to scavenging among the ruins. Most curious of all was a floating stone in the town center, covered in glowing runes that none could decipher - though Bartleby, ever the scholar, took care to copy them down.

A mighty peculiar day's work, if you ask this old river pilot.
