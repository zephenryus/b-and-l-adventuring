# 2025-05-02 - The Unicorn's Bargain

## Breaking News from Thither

**WAYWARD POOL INFILTRATED! Kids Crack Ancient Magic, Orc Spy Exposed!**

In a daring alliance with local children, our heroes donned makeshift unicorn costumes to breach the mystical [[Wayward Pool]] defenses! The young rebels—[[Sassy]], Sparky, and Kitty Cat—revealed the pool's secret: only unicorns (or convincing fakes) can approach the sacred waters.

But danger lurked! A rotting orc spy named [[Zarak]] ambushed the party, wielding garrote daggers for his master [[Kellek]]—a powerful necromancer seeking unicorn horns to break temporal magic on Zilbna's tower. Under Zone of Truth, Zarak spilled secrets of the League of Malevolence before escaping into the night.

The mission's crown jewel: contact with [[Lamorna]] the Unicorn! The majestic creature revealed her mate [[Eladon]] was enslaved by [[Granny Nightshade]], his horn stolen. Breaking Bavlorna's time-freeze spell would require Lamorna's own horn—a terrible sacrifice that hangs in the balance.

**NEW QUESTS DISCOVERED:**
- [[Break the Temporal Freeze]] - Unicorn horn needed to shatter time magic
- [[Get Boggle-oil for Squirt]] - Mountain dwarves hold the key
- [[Rescue Eladon]] - Free Lamorna's enslaved mate

The heroes now face an impossible choice: convince a noble unicorn to sacrifice her horn, or find another way to break the temporal prison trapping Bavlorna's tower. Meanwhile, the sinister League of Malevolence closes in, led by the disease-spreading necromancer Kellek.

Will our heroes save both the unicorns and break the spell? The clock—frozen though it may be—is ticking!
