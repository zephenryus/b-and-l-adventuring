**Dateline: Witchlight Carnival — February 24, 2024**
**MISSING MAGIC, STOLEN TIMEPIECE, AND MONARCHY IN FLIGHT!**

Tonight’s top story: Burley the bugbear blows the whistle on the Witchlight Carnival’s darker side—things (and people!) are vanishing without a trace, and he wants *you* to steal the source of the circus’s control: Mr. Witch’s enchanted pocket watch!

The party schmoozed with displacer beast Durlagron, learned of missing cubs and vanishing valuables, and uncovered a rogue’s gallery of shady tagalongs—Sowpig, a moon-masked mystery, and a cryptic toad.

Inside the Hall of Illusions, Candlefoot the mime—voiceless thanks to a thieving kanku—offers magical aid in return for his silenced speech. Meanwhile, a coronation unfolds under the big top! A halfling is crowned monarch, fireworks fly (courtesy of Burley), and the guards vanish—leaving the back tent wide open. Lotta tails Mr. Witch and Durlagron to a cluster of staff wagons, spying a clown with a Joker’s smile and empty knife belt. Yikes.

As wings sprout from the freshly crowned monarch, Destiny proposes a fake wedding with Jackie to boost joy levels and gain favor. And just like that, with glitter in the air and secrets in motion, the carnival clock ticks toward a daring heist…

---

- Went to the big top. Burley was at the door talking to the guard. 
- We casually walk over to Burley. Lotta talks to Burley and tells him that Eliwick told us to talk to him. 
- "Bugbears is people too." 
- Burley took us to the back of the tent. He says we might be able to help. "Bad things have been happening at the carnival. People and things have been going missing."
- He knows about Sowpig, but she is not part of the carnival, but they come with the carnival. 
- Three creatures tag along with the carnival: human with pig mask (Sowpig), human with moon mask, and toad creature. Mr. Witch and Mr. Light won't talk about it. 
- Mr. Witch has a pocket watch that runs the carnival. It is magically connected to the carnival. The best way to get in touch with Mr. Witch is at the midnight extravaganza. 
- Burley says steal the watch. Enter the midnight extravaganza to meet directly with Mr. Witch. The chain is magic. Being crowned monarch will get you close to him. 
- to be crowned monarch you need to contribute to the happiness of the carnival. 
- Not everyone is trustworthy. Trustworthy: Candlefoot (hall of illusions), Polasha (merperson), and Durligron (lost property tent). Untrustworthy: Thacko (clown). In general avoid clowns. 
- We go to the Lost Property tent. There is a weird, large cat. The cat (meta gaming: a Displacer Beast), is Durligron. 
- Durlagron lost one of his cubs years ago. The cub just disappeared. Like how Burley described. 
- Hurley is one that has gone missing. 
- Things that go missing are things with intrinsic value, not monetary value.
- Destiny told Durlagron that Mr. Witch got nervous when he mentioned Sowpig. 
- Don't approach Mr. Witch directly. Durlagron also mentioned the watch as well. 
- Try to sneak in to the staff area. Thorns block the way. May need to go through with a staff member. 
- We received a replacement watch to swap with Mr. Witch's watch. 
- We travel to the Hall of Illusions to talk to Candlefoot. We stop to talk to the black and white mime, he is Candlefoot. Lost his voice to a Kancu. He is a worlock or Fae. 
- He knows about Sowpig. He knows things and people have been going missing. 
- If we could get his voice back he would be willing to help us get the watch. He will use his magic to help us. 
- We go to the crowning. Durlagron ushers Mr. Witch in at the end. Mr. Light comes down on the trapeze. Candlefoot is on the side holding a hat box. The two guards at the back tent to the staff area are gone. We don't notice where Burley are. Turns out he was setting off fireworks. 
- Mr. Light gives a peach and pulls out a weather vane. It points at a little halfling. Mr. Witch and Candlefoot come forward. He pulls out the crown and places it on the halfling. Mr. White "knights" the halfling with the weather vane. Troop of clowns throw tons of glitter (may be a good distraction). 
- Mr. Witch and Mr. Light take the monarch around the big top. The mere woman sings. Everyone leaves the tent. 
- Mr. Witch and Durlagron split off alone from the parade shortly after leaving the big top and head back into the staff area. 
- Lotta sneaks through the big top to check out the staff area. She sees the wagons circled. One wagon is fancier than the others. There is a human clown with a bubble pipe sitting in the middle. He has a painted on grin (think Joker). On his hip is a belt that would hold knifes, but it is empty. 
- Jessica approached the monarch. She just had fun and did the games. 
- Destiny recommends pretending to marry Jackie to improve the happiness of the carnival. 
- The monarch sprouts wings and can fly. There is definitely some enchantment happening. 
- Burley passes us some extra tickets for the next day.
