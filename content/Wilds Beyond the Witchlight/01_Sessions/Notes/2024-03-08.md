- We take a long rest. 
- We have breakfast. We talk to Destiny about Sowpig and his "regrets." In his hometown he did something very cowardly and played it off heroic. He can never go home and own up to his story. 
	- His best friend and he were working in the woods. They were attacked. He out ran his friend. He ran back to help his friend hoping it would kill him too. Accidently killed the creature. He brought his friend home, but made everyone believe that he had tried to save his friend. 
	- Barney consoled Destiny telling him that anyone would have done the same. Barney is 14-years-old. 
	- Lotta tells us about losing Tucker, her dog, to the goblins. 
	- Jackie's father showed preference for her younger sister. She is trying to prove herself.
	- I told them:
> Bartleby's mother fell gravely ill suddenly, her condition deteriorating rapidly. Despite his extensive knowledge and skill in healing, Bartleby found himself struggling to diagnose and treat her ailment. He scoured ancient texts and consulted fellow healers in Waterdeep, but no cure seemed effective. As her condition worsened, Bartleby grew more desperate, resorting to rare and experimental treatments, yet nothing yielded results.
>
> He felt the weight of expectation and responsibility heavily; as a renowned healer, failing to save his own mother was inconceivable. He spent sleepless nights by her bedside, chanting prayers and employing every healing spell he knew. His mother, aware of his efforts and his distress, would often tell him not to worry, that she was proud of him regardless of the outcome.
>
> In the end, despite Bartleby's tireless efforts, his mother passed away peacefully, leaving him with a mix of grief and unresolved guilt. He couldn't help but wonder if there was something more he could have done, a cure he overlooked, or a treatment he hadn't thought of. This experience left a deep impact on Bartleby, fueling his dedication to his healing practice but also haunting him with the regret of not being able to save one of the people he loved most.
- 
	- Destiny had a rough night sleep. He took 2 points of exhaustion. 
- Destiny has a marriage license ready. Barney suggested a Bachelorette party. 
- We head to:
	- **The Dragonfly Ride**: Ride large dragonflies. Able to direct the dragonflies a bit. Tree Ent is at the. Entrance to the ride. The Ent is talking to people. I just went up and down. Lotta and Barney spot a blue-black bird person (Kenku). They give chase. They find a hole where the Kenku hides. It's by Silversong Lake. The Kenku looks like a gnome child. Lotta, Barney, and Destiny. Barney casts thorn whip and hits the Kenku. Jackie and Bartleby watch from a ways away. The Kenku transform back into a Kenku. It is bloodied. Destiny stabilizes the Kenku and gives it a health potion. The Kenku casts a spell on Barney and tries to stab him with a dagger. Lotta shoots an arrow between its legs (on purpose). Destiny thumps it on its head. Jackie walks away. The Kenku runs away, casts a spell. A cloud emits from its hands and everyone except Jackie becomes unconscious. Jackie looks on and decides to track the Kenku (leaving the party unconscious). She watches where it goes. It runs toward the staff area along the river. She talks to the Kenku. The Kenku doesn't realize she was with our group and parlays with her. Jackie pretends that she doesn't know what just happened. She introduces herself as Kettlestream. Leads Jackie back to the "attackers." Jackie asks Kettlestream about the entrance to Prismere. She tells Jackie that her patron has stopped giving her power. She is causing mischief the carnival until Mr. Light and Mr. Witch help her. Her patron was Zilbna. Mr. Witch and Mr. Light allow the hourglass coven to take what they want and they stay in business. If we get into Prismere and find Zilbna. The rest of us pretend to stay unconscious or slowly gets up. Barney tries to apologize, but she pulls a dagger on him. She takes 6 gold in apology from Barney. She gives back Mr. Candlefoot's voice. We tell her we're helping Madric the Warlock to find a way into Prismere. Madric and Zilbna share a patron and they are rivals. We share our plan with Kettlestream. She was thinking of stealing the weathervane. I realize that her undoing the spell may not be permanent, but may be redone again in the future. 
	- **The Pixie Kingdom**: It's cute. 
- Candlefoot now has his voice back.
