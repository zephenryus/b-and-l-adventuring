Planning to lift the watch off Mr. Light
- Barney, Jackie, and Bartleby will try to distract Mr. White. 
- Lotta and Destiny is going to try to cut the fabric to loose the watch. 
- We go to speak to the giant swan. Barney asks what his chicken foot is. She says it's just a chicken foot. He plays a mathematically unique song on his pan pipe. He rolls a nat-1. She is unimpressed. 
- We went to go see Durligron the big cat. Lotta shows him her shaul. He is unsure what the properties are, but that it is old and has the scent of the Faewild on it. He comments that everyone in the group has something that smells of the Faewild. My ball and cup game smell. The object may just be connected to the Faewild or have some form of arcane magic. Prizes today were not weird magic; they are more traditional. He recommends speaking to Mr. Light and Mr. Witch. 
- We performed at the bigtop. Everyone does well. We get in line to meet Mr. Light and Mr. Witch. Lotta drinks her potion of advantage. 
- Woman speaks to them before. 
- We finally got to meet them. We make our distracting performance. They're pretty convinced and distracted. 
- Lotta steals the watch. Destiny replaces the watch with the second watch. He wants to hire us. 
- We are taken back to the staff area. We address the issue of the hags. Lotta tells them about the stolen watch. Lotta informs them when they need us they know where to find us. 
- Mr. Witch announces that he wants us to stick around. We decided to stay in the big top. Destiny closes the tent doors. Burley steps off to the side to not be directly associated with us. 
- Mr. Witch tells us that the carnival issues and our quest to find Zilbna are all connected. He takes us to the Hall of Illusions. 
- We stand in front of a mirror and say a chant. They ask for the watch. Mr. Light grabs the watch and gives it to Mr. Witch. They leave in a puff of smoke. 
- We say the words in front of the mirror. Destiny, Jackie, me, Barney, and Lotta say the rhyme. As Lotta looks around before she goes through, she hears a voice says, "mind the rule of three: future, present, past. Find the allicorn, free the dormant queen at last."
- We enter Prismeer. We are standing on a delapidated bridge. We are above a swamp. There a lot of animal noises.

The song I wrote and sang at the Big Top Event:

**Chorus:**
Come one, come all, let melodies fly,
For “Bonded and Licensed,” we’re your best buy!
With music and might, we shine so bright,
Hire us now, and delight in the night!

**Verse 1:**
Jackie grows tall, her strength knows no bound,
In battle, she towers, with foes all around.
Barney’s might, a spectacle grand,
Feats of strength with the wave of his hand.

**Chorus:**
Come one, come all, let melodies fly,
For “Bonded and Licensed,” we’re your best buy!
With music and might, we shine so bright,
Hire us now, and delight in the night!

**Verse 2:**
Lotta’s keen eye, and Destiny’s aim,
Together they strike, their arrows aflame.
While Bartleby’s music carries the air,
Songs of hope mingle with flair.

**Chorus:**
Come one, come all, let melodies fly,
For “Bonded and Licensed,” we’re your best buy!
With music and might, we shine so bright,
Hire us now, and delight in the night!

**Bridge:**
From village fairs to royal courts,
We play, we fight, in all sorts.
A band like no other, a spectacle to see,
“Bonded and Licensed,” as good as can be!

**Chorus:**
Come one, come all, let melodies fly,
For “Bonded and Licensed,” we’re your best buy!
With music and might, we shine so bright,
Hire us now, and delight in the night!
