- Lotta attuned to Agnon's branding iron. 
- We get on the skiff and start heading towards Bavlorna's shack. The center of the lake is obscured by fog. 
- We stop and make a plan. We talk about the Lornlings. Find the cauldron. Do we get in her good graces then bait and switch? Do we get close and stab her?
- Jackie had been reading the journal. It was disturbing. It was mostly vengeance. 
- the corpses are for her to taxidermy. Weird. 
- Lotta will do a whistle if things go bad. 
- We are going to go in, give her our gifts, then attack. Need to decide if it is a stabby-stabby time. "Agdon" is the key word to start stabby-stabby. If we talk about the goblin puppet, we leave peacefully. We take credit for the corpses. 
- We roll into the fog. We look up and see that we are at the base of a giant cottage. It's 30 feet above us on stilts. It's covered in moss. We see a rickety old stair case. The foundation of the courage is resting on what looks like one of the o-wells. The stairs wrap around the well. There is a trap door at the top of the stairs. 
- We decide to head up the staircase. There does not appear to be anyone around. (side note: we came here by portal, so if we get stranded we can probably find a portal or teleporter).
- Destiny checks to see if there is anything magical. There is nothing obvious. We haul the crate up the stairs. We reach the trap door. Lotta tries the door. It moves up like it is not locked. She throws it open. It makes a loud clang. She looks in. 
- it is a cluttered room. There is a recessed pool that is covered in algae. The pool takes up most of the room. The well comes up into the room. It smells like swamp. There is a tarnished mirror. Floating on the water is a large lily pad. The walkway around the pool is cluttered. It seems like a hoarder's house. There is another staircase that goes up another floor. There are five doors that lead out of the room. 
- We loudly drop the box. Lotta hollors. Destiny goes and checks out the mannequins. Barney checks out the lily pad. The lily pad seems like it is free floating. "If this is a teleportation lily pad if I roll it up would she be stuck where she is?" He pokes his staff into the water. The pool is 5 feet deep. 
- There are seven mannequins. One of them has very poorly made clothing on it. Maybe it is Bavlorna's clothing. One only has a witches hat. Nothing particularly interesting. He touches the one with the pointy black hat. The hat is sitting on a Dark Mantle. It throws its tentacles and strikes Destiny. Destiny backs of. The Dark Mantle pulls the hat back down. 
- Jackie listened to one of the doors. She hears some creatures moving around. She knocks. She heard frogs croaking. She opens the door. There is a balcony on the side of the the cottage. It is covered in frogs (normal sized frogs). The clothes line is attached on either side of the balcony. There is nothing other than the frogs. Lotta tries to pick up a frog. 
- Barney talks to the frogs. The mostly just say, "fly."
- Lotta goes out to the balcony. She can't see much because of the fog. The frogs get louder. She walks back in and shuts the door. 
- Jackie goes to the door on the West side. She listens at the door. She heard nothing. She opens the door. As the door opens the door she sees a dead horse head. It is attached to an 8-legged creature. There is a create and there are flies. There are a bunch of taxidermied creatures. They are mash ups of multiple animals. It must be Bavlorna's taxidermy lab. 
- Destiny goes into the shop to look for the stag skull. The create has Bavlorna's name on it.
- Barney opens the create. There are a bunch of flies. The frogs will not come inâ€”the won't leave the balcony. He inspects the horse head spider thing. Destiny recognizes it as a baselisk. They have the ability to turn people to stone with its gaze. It's primary food source is stone. Destiny recognized the baselisk because it killed his friend. 
- three Lornlings come doored the stairs. We tell them have the corpses for Bavlorna. The tell us they will tell her and go back upstairs. 
- Destiny opens another door. There are stairs that go up, but on the outside of the cottage. There's is another door at the top of the stairs. There is a steady droning coming from the top of the stairs. Destiny says, "let's just go kill Bavlorna." He goes to another door. There are just scraps of cloth attacked up. It is a mishmash of various things. He begins up the outside stairs. He steps on the first two steps. They crumble and fall to the swamp. He falls back into the room. Jackie takes him by the hand to calm him down. Destiny likes that. 
- Barney opens the last door. It creaks very loud. There is a large cupboard in the middle of the room against the far wall. They're is an hourglass in silver on the cupboard. Lotta and Bartleby notice that the sigil can be manipulated. There is an apothecary behind the cupboard doors. Lotta looks at the sigil. We play with it a bit. Spinning sigil until the hourglass is upside-down opens doors. 
- There are lots of materials. More clutter: horse shoes, letters. It's mostly useless. There is a small cauldron, inside is a note that says, "spittle spew." None of them are written to Bavlorna. They span a wide range of time periods. 
- We decide to all head up the stairs where the Lornlings went. 
- We come into a hallway. The hall is lined with portraits. Most species are represented. No one in the portraits looks happy. The art is just weird. There is a mirror in the center of hanging on the wall. 
- Destiny encourages Lotta to enter the door in the hall with one door. The room resembles a study. It is covered in clutter and trash. There is an arm chair a love seat. There are two people sitting in the chairs. One has large eyes and resembles a toad. She has two Lornlings on her shoulders. There is a staircase that seems to go up to the attic. One of them has gray skin. 
- Bavlorna speaks to us and asks why we're there. Lotta tells her we're here to bring her the create of dead animals and a book. Jackie holds up the book. Bavlorna asks for the book. Lotta tells her we need to travel to Thither. She says she wants us to do chores. Her water feature is leaking and she wants her create of corpses. 
- the gray woman tells us we should leave. We drag Destiny from the room. We notice that she has no shadow.
