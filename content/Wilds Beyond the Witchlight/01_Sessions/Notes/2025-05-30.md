- In [Yon](Yon.md) there is Amador the Dandelion that can help us get to the [Palace of Heart's Desire](Palace%20of%20Heart's%20Desire.md) (this is [[Zilbna|Zilbna's]] palace). On the second floor is a library with items.
- In [Thither](Thither.md) there is a creature called a Jabberwocky. It patrols the forest looking for prey.
- [Squirt](Squirt.md) can help us get to [Yon](Yon.md).
- [Destin-y Dub](Destin-y%20Dub.md) does his psionic hops. We take a long rest.
- Destiny shows his elven tooth and tarnished silver necklace to the Unicorn. We show her the items we got out of the o'well. She tells us that each of our items comes from one of the regions of [Prismeer](Prismeer.md).
	- We show her the marionette. It reminds her of [Endalin Moongrave](Endalin%20Moongrave.md).
	- **Ethereal shoal**: it's a cloak of invisibility ([Lotta Corzaren](Lotta%20Corzaren.md)). It can only cast invisibility for one hour twice in 24 hours. It only works in Yon. It is fragmented.
	- **Ball and Cup**: It is from Thither ([Bartleby the Bard](Bartleby%20the%20Bard.md)). It works the same as a potion of vitality. It only has one use. It has to be commanded.
	- **Chicken Foot**: It is from [Hither](Hither.md) ([Barnabus Fleetfoot](Barnabus%20Fleetfoot.md)). If you break the bone when you need an answer you will get the answer.
	- **Iron finger**: it is from Yon (Lotta). She doesn't know what it is for.
	- **Tooth**: It is from Yon ([Destin-y](Destin-y%20Dub.md)). A relic from a hero when Prismeer was having battles. It has been lost to time. It will give the same as a potion of heroism. It has 3 total uses.
	- **Piano Key**: It is from Thither ([Jaquline](Jaquline.md)). It acts as a charm of dark vision. Dark vision for 8 hours.
- Prismeer has become distorted. [Hither](Hither.md) is lost souls and has the O'wells. [Thither](Thither.md) is connected to lost children. Time is wonky in [Yon](Yon.md). If we don't free Zilbna, Prismeer will be destroyed.
- Death is not necessarily permanent. Souls transform. The harm the hags are doing is literally breaking apart Prismeer. *[Eladon](Endalin%20Moongrave.md) is the Alacorn*!
- We decide to head to the mountains near the [Wayward Pool](Wayward%20Pool.md). As we walk we come across a trail of monstrous claw prints. Each print is three feet from heel to toe. It's got to be the Jabberwocky. Jackie says they belong to a dragon-like creature. Lotta checks if the prints are heading the same direction. It is heading the same direction. We continue on the same path. Lotta gets her cloak ready. Jackie gets her axe ready.
- We follow the trail for a couple miles. Suddenly the prints are just gone. Pretty much everyone realizes it is in the sky. We look up. There is not a dragon shaped cutout in the trees. The prints are not super fresh. There is a good chance if it had taken off recently we would have seen it, but we did not.
- It takes close to a full day to get to the mountain Pass. There is a massive cave. Barney calls, "hi-ho!" Nothing happens. Barney looks for a door. He finds an optical illusion. There is a path in what looks like a wall. He calls to the rest of us and tells us to watch. He steps in. We follow. Bartleby and Destin-y light hooded Lanterns. Barney, Jackie, and Lotta have dark vision. Barney is calling to the dwarves in Dwarvish. There is no real response. We keep going.
- Jackie notices that the dirt is shuffled and looks like there are footprints. They are wide. We decide that they are dwarves.
- We remember [Gundrun](Gundrun%20Rockseeker.md). We remember [Wave Echo Cave](Wave%20Echo%20Cave.md), when we found the doppelganger and fought the female drow elf that stepped into the portal. that there was a symbol with an hourglass. We realize that the drow elf must have been connected to the [Hourglass Coven](Hourglass%20Coven.md).
- We notice that we have been going down further. It is getting colder. The soft dirt slowly changes to hard stone. It is a road. There are still no dwarves. Lotta starts to wonder if something weird is going on. The cave is widening.
- We keep pressing on. We begin to notice Lanterns on the side of the road that are unlit. They are coal fueled lanterns, and there is no sign of fuel. It has been close to an hour and a half of travel.
- We decide to go another hour. About 15 minutes later, the lanterns become more common and we start to see buildings. They are mostly facade buildings, like the old west. We come to a natural lip. We see [a city below us](Abandoned%20Dwarven%20City.md). The buildings are lumped rocks that are carved into homes. There are signs in Dwarvish. All the houses are dark. There is some light in some buildings—it resembles bioluminescence.
- We blow out our lanterns. The bioluminescent lights spell "lost," in Dwarvish. We start looking for words on the walls.
- As Barney wanders around the lights remind him of when they paint the outside of homes with the number of dead. He finds more Dwarvish runes: "We've been failed," and "The rune slab lies."
- Lotta and Jackie go into the house with "lost" written on it. There is a lot of stuff still where it was left. It has a thick coat of dust. The house is two stories. There is a bedroom. There is still cloths left. On the bed is a pile of rocks that looks like Karin. Lotta finds a bottle of oil.
- They go to the next home and compare. The non-"lost" home is a mess. It is ransacked. People were packing and getting out in a hurry. There is still a layer of dust, but not as much. There is not a pile of rocks. There is no oil. They took their tools. Other of the non-tagged homes are similar.
- Barney starts look at the bookshelf. He picks up a book called *Assassins and Turtles*.

- We continue further into town. It becomes more dense.
- Destiny and Bartleby light their Lanterns and rejoin the group.
- Destiny enters a house and tries to pick up stones of one of the cairns.
- The city is broken up into seven segments, like a pie cut into seven slices. There are spoke streets. The center of town seems to be glowing a little brighter.
- As we start down a street towards the center of town, we notice a sliver of phosphorescent light in a house as we walk by. We notice that there is something covering the window and there is bioluminescent lighting inside.
- Lotta cracks open the door (11 stealth) and looks around. On the mantle of a fireplace is a hooded lantern. The lantern is the source of light. There is a plate with food on it. It is not old or spoiled. It looks very fresh. Lotta thinks someone is there. There is dust, but it's been disturbed. There are footprints in the dust, but they are not Dwarven footprints. They appear to be small or halfling.
- Lotta comes out and tells the party. Barney says, "Hello," in Dwarvish. Lotta starts following the footprints. She hears rattling coming from behind a door upstairs. It sounds like metal pots clanking together. Lotta asks if, "anyone [is] there?" A little creature slightly opens the door holding a pan and says, "if you're going to eat me, do it quick!"
- [Wrefren Boldkind](Wrefren%20Boldkind.md) is a purple-Grey gnome—a deep gnome. He has been scavenging. Barney asks what happened here. He tells us that the dwarves turned into the cairns. He has come here to get things to sell. There is a rumbling every so often. He leaves and comes back every two weeks. He confirms that the oil we found is in fact Boggle oil.
- There is a stone in the center of town. It's hovering off the ground. It has lines of runes that glow. None of us can read the runes. Bartleby writes down some of the runes.
